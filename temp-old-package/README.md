# DEPRECATED

This package has been renamed to [`@nsmr/pixelart-react`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@nsmr/pixelart-react).

## Migration

Update your package.json:

```diff
- "@nicholuassommer/pixelarticons-react": "^1.0.1"
+ "@nsmr/pixelart-react": "^2.0.0"
```

Update your imports:

```diff
- import { PixelArtIcon } from '@nicholuassommer/pixelarticons-react'
+ import { PixelArtIcon } from '@nsmr/pixelart-react'
```

## Why the change?

The new package name is shorter, more concise, and easier to remember. It also better reflects the focus on pixel art icons for React.
